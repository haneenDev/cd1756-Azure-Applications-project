# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

I chose web app service since it is lower than a VMs in terms of cost. IT requires much less managerial efforts in comparison to Azure Virtual Machines. 

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 

I would consider potentially using a virtual machine if they had more "cookie-cutter" or "plug-in-play" template functionality for web app services and continuous deployments as compared to the PAS web app Azure service offerings that streamline changes and deployments from a GitHub repo or other sources. A virtual machine takes a lot of thoughtful planning and work to make it secure and up-to-date, so I do not see this changing in the near future.
